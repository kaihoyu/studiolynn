## 01 Agent Patrol
Use the NavMesh component in Unity, to produce a certain amount of humanoid agents that can navigate in a designated map (composed by 3D geometries) and avoid obstacles. 


### 1.1 Static Obstacle

Create a single plane and few cubes as obstacle geometry, in "static," set geometries as "Navigation Static." In the "Navigation" panel, next to "Inspector," bake the NavMesh map.

Create a 3D object, capsule, as an abstracted model of humanoid agent. In the "Inspector" panel, click "Add Component" and type in "Nav Mesh Agent," adjust the speed and acceleration to control the movement of agent. Drag and drop *Patrol* script to the inspector of the agent, to apply the patrol behavior. Use cube or sphere as waypoint geometries. 

### 1.2 Moving Obstacle



## 02 Customized Robot


## 03 Flow Vignette


## System
Unity version: 2019.2.10f1
